-An example of how to run your program:
-1. please change the filePath of “words” file based on the location of “words” on your computer.(For example(on my computer): /Users/leweny/Desktop/asgt2/asgt2/words) 
-2. After you load this Project”asgt2” into Xcode , Click to “build and then run the current scheme” to  run it.

-Files Lists: main.m ; AnagramPrecesser.h ; AnagramPrecesser.m
-Development Environment:
-	1. MacBook Pro (15-inch, Mid 2009)/ 2.8 GHz Intel Core 2 Duo/ 8 GB 1067 MHz DDR3/ NVIDIA GeForce 9400M 256 MB/ 240 GB Solid State SATA Drive
-	2. OS X YOsemite 10.10.5 (14F27)

------------
-Description: 
-Given the file CS411SampleCode/sample_data/words.zip in the course Git Hub repository, find all the anagrams. What are the words that form the largest set of anagrams given the words in the file? How long does your program take to calculate the answer in seconds?
-
-My Program Description:
-Step:	1) Load the “words”file line by line into an Array(NSArray)
-	2) adds a word to the processor and classify by HashMap(NSDictionary)
-		First, order a word into alphabet order as a hash key by Quick Sort.
-		Second, check whether this hash key has already existed.(if yes, add it to the related Value Set of this hash key by address; if no, create a new hash key and related value set to save it.)
-		Third, check and update hash key Of largest set of anagrams.
-	3) after process every word, get the largest set of anagrams by hashKeyOfBiggestSet and output the related set.

-The words that form the largest set of anagrams given the words in the file are as following:
-2016-02-04 21:49:54.001 asgt2[1729:55765] (
-    angor,
-    argon,
-    goran,
-    grano,
-    groan,
-    nagor,
-    Orang,
-    orang,
-    organ,
-    rogan,
-    Ronga
-)
